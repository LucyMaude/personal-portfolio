                Lucy first discovered her passion for tech while at the University of Richmond. For all four years, she worked at the University’s Technology Learning Center where she learned the ins-and-outs of a variety of software and taught students, faculty, and staff to use these programs. After graduating, she worked in Virginia for 2 years before deciding to chase her interest in development. In 2017 she and her husband packed their car and drove to Salt Lake City to attend VSchool, a web development boot camp. After completing the program, she started her own business designing and developing websites.

            <p class="bottom-p"> Lucy loves to try new things. Her personal motto is: “Do not go where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail” (Ralph Waldo Emerson). This has led her to live in Santiago Chile, join Frisbee and lacrosse teams, and learn sewing and Logic Pro (among many other things). She also has a knack for teaching and leadership; instructing Spanish and music classes while over-seas and leading meetings for her volunteer organizations from the time she was in High School.
